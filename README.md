# OpenMMT Project

Welcome to the OpenMMT project! Our mission is to create an open-source, collaboratively built macroeconomic model of the United States, grounded in [Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory). This initiative seeks to develop a comprehensive and accurate representation of the U.S. economy, capturing the intricate dynamics between federal taxes, government spending, inflation, and various economic actors.

# Project Vision

The OpenMMT project aspires to democratize economics by making sophisticated economic modeling accessible to everyone. Our goal is to bring transparency to the relationship between policy-making and economic outcomes, allowing a broader audience to understand and engage with these critical processes. By standardizing a model that can be used for testing and developing theories outside the academic realm, we aim to empower individuals, educators, policymakers, and researchers alike.

# Key Objectives

1. **Accurate Representation**: Our model will strive to accurately reflect the complexities of the U.S. economy, including the interplay between public and private sector activities, inflationary pressures, and the role of federal taxes and spending.

2. **Dynamic System Modeling**: We'll incorporate a dynamic system approach to account for lagging effects and feedback loops in economic activities, ensuring that our model can capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

3. **Collaborative Development**: We believe in the power of collective intelligence. By opening up the project to contributions from economists, data scientists, programmers, and enthusiasts, we aim to create a robust and well-rounded model.

4. **Educational Resource**: Beyond its practical applications, macrommt aims to serve as a valuable educational tool. Students, educators, and anyone interested in macroeconomics can explore the model, understand its components, and see real-time data applications.

5. **Standardization for Theory Testing**: We aim to provide a standardized platform that can be used to test and develop economic theories outside the confines of academia. This will enable a diverse range of users to experiment with and validate their ideas in a rigorous, data-driven environment.
