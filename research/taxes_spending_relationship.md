# Editing Experiment: The Relationship between Federal Taxes and Federal Spending

## Tests / Hypotheses

1. **Federal Spending**: 
   - Hypothesis: Federal spending is not constrained by federal taxes. It is also unrelated to firm or consumer savings. The currency-issuing authority can flex fiscal policy within the constraints of inflation.
   
2. **Decoupling of Federal Taxes, Spending, and the National Debt**: 
   - Hypothesis: The national debt could be set at any level as a policy choice within the confines of inflation. The current policy choice is to define it as the difference between federal spending and federal taxes.
   
3. **The National Debt**: 
   - Hypothesis: The national debt is currently the difference between federal spending and federal taxes by policy.
   
4. **Fiscal Relationship to Inflation**: 
   - Hypothesis: Both federal taxes and federal spending impact inflation.
   
5. **Monetary Relationship to Inflation**: 
   - Hypothesis: High levels of national debt and high interest rates on the national debt may influence inflation through the wealth effect, as interest payments to the private sector increase their spending capacity.
